# Statistics Toolkit

A personal repository of Applied Statistics workflows that combine clean implementation with explanatory depth.

Each notebook covers a complete workflow â€” from setup to summary â€” while staying readable to both technical and non-technical users. Theory is seamlessly integrated to strengthen understanding.

## ðŸ§  What's Inside

### **1. A/B Testing** ([HTML](./AB_Testing/AB_Testing.html))

- Experiment setup with config-driven control  
- Randomization logic (simple, cluster, match-pair)  
- AA testing and diagnostics  
- Sample size & power analysis

### **2. Hypothesis Testing** ([HTML](./Hypothesis_Testing/Hypothesis_Testing.html))

- Parametric and non-parametric test selection  
- Normality and variance checks  
- Paired vs unpaired logic  
- Significance interpretation and output labeling

### **3. Statistical Distributions** ([HTML](./Statistical_Distributions/Statistical_Distributions.html))

- Continuous: Uniform, Normal, Exponential, Chi-Square, Student t  
- Discrete: Poisson, Bernoulli, Binomial  
- Visualizations, sampling, parameter estimation

### **4. Statistical Paradoxes** ([HTML](./Statistical_Distributions/Statistical_Paradoxes.html))

- Simpsonâ€™s Paradox  
- Will Rogers Phenomenon

### **5. Theoretical Foundations** ([HTML](./Statistical_Distributions/Statistical_Theorems.html))

- Law of Large Numbers (with visual convergence)  
- Central Limit Theorem (sample mean simulation)
